Answer these questions:
1. Provide link to GitHub repository for TAs to view the code? (1 point)
2. List what backend technologies you are using and why? (2 points)

We are using XAMPP(MySql) to run our backend because it allows us to create and store all our information we need in databases fairly easily.

| Member | Contributions | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Daniel Berreles Mendoza | Fuel Quote Page, Fuel Quote History Page | I updated my pages to include the backend code in PHP. Since the database will be required for the fuel quote history page, I will update the page when I can use the database.   |
| Romaine Lewis | Login Page, Client Registration Page | I updated the visuals of the login and registration pages and also linked them to a database called logins that allows for user login and registration. |
| Tyonne Zachery | Client Profile Management | Made additions to the Client Profile Management php page to add in “MySql” functionality for the future database. |
